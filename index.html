                <h3>Sister Locs and Traditional Locs</h3>
                <p>Getting locs is not just a change of hairstyle but also a change of lifestyle. During a traditional maintenance session, it will take a loctician 45 mins to 1 hour and a half to palm roll a full set of traditional locs. Sisterlocs are microlocs that are interlocked using a special tool. When sisterlocs are installed, depending on your hair length, your hair may be interlocked down the length of your hair, but definitely at the root. This allows you to have the locs without having to go through the different phases of locking your hair. Therefore, they are perfect for people who would find it challenging to grow traditional locks and prefer quick results. Locs allow for a range of possibilities in styling, including playing around with color. They can be formed in braids, twists, set on rollers, put into updos, cut into shorter lengths and more. Loc-wearers can be incredibly creative, incorporating hair jewelry and shells into their styles as well.</p>

                <h3>Braids and Twists</h3>
                <p>Protective styling is one of the best and most efficient ways to achieve longer hair, strengthen your hair, and keep it healthy. The most popular go-to styles for naturalistas when they want a protective style are braids and twists. The history of Black people braiding their hair is deeply rooted in African culture and has been a significant part of our identity for centuries. Hair braiding holds both cultural and historical significance, representing various social, ethnic, and personal meanings.</p>

                <h3>Wash and Condition</h3>
                <p>Washing and conditioning our natural hair can be a task that no one wants to worry about. It’s understandable if you are maybe unsure about the best way to wash your hair, or you wonder what the best shampoo for natural hair is, or the best hair wash routine. Kandase uses the right techniques that can significantly improve your hair structure to achieve the maximum shine, the largest possible volume and the long-lasting health of your hair. Without the right care, Black hair may become fragile, dry, or damaged. There are many ways to keep the hair healthy and hydrated while reducing the risk of breakage.</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>Oh, the dreaded struggle to find the right loctician/hair stylist who is familiar with the Black natural hair texture. For many of us, a trip to the hair salon is more than a task on our to-do list — it's a sanctuary, a mecca, and a place to go when we just want to feel brand new. Kandase (appropriately pronounced ‘can do’) Khepra has created a hair salon that targets Black women and men with sister locs, traditional locs, two strand twists, and various types of braid hairstyles. <br/><br/>
                There may be many Black beauty salons in Chicago, but what makes Kandase stand out from the pack is her commitment to provide the most professional and courteous service for the Black community. She recognizes that every Black person with natural hair has unique hair needs and her goal is to make you feel and look your best!</p>
